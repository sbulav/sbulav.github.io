If you're managing a lot of GitHub repositories you're probably using 
GitHub Actions. One extremely powerful action is [github-script](https://github.com/actions/github-script).
Using this script you can access any of GitHub APIs to do such things as
modify repository permissions, manage GitHub App Installations, spread
secrets, and many many other things.

Today I learned that there is an official
[automate-github-using-github-script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/automate-github-using-github-script)
course from Microsoft.

It's pretty small but gives a nice introduction into github script and
underlying Octokit. It's free so it's worth checking out if you're using
GitHub and/or GitHub Actions.

title: "Linkedin location and HR activity"

Couple weeks ago I had a discussion on HR's activity in LinkedIn and location in
your profile there.

For the sake of curiosity I've changed my Location to Minsk, Belarus. Ofcourse,
times now are pretty rough and HR activity is at it's minimum - but I haven't
noticed any differences whether it's Voronezh or Minsk. Even amount of profile
views are the same.

So, @tenhishadow you were not right.

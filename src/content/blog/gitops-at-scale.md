I've passed the course [GitOps at Scale](https://learning.codefresh.io/course/gitops-at-scale)
and follow up exam:

This is a [second course on ArgoCD](https://sbulav.github.io/certifications/gitops-certified-for-argo/). It
has short and precise materials, useful pieces of advice on deploying and managing
ArgoCD. The team did a great job on this course!

During this course you'll learn:
- How to manage external clusters with ArgoCD
- How to use the app-of-apps pattern to group similar applications
- How to use ApplicationSets to automatically generate applications
- How to organize your GitOps repositories
- How to promote releases between environments
- How to use Argo Image Updater
- How to customize the diff process in ArgoCD
- How to use sync hooks and waves for resource ordering
- How to use sync windows to disable/enable deployment periods
- How to employ ArgoCD notifications

The course itself is pretty long and gives you the ability to test
everything in practice.

The final test has 50 questions with a passing score of 85%.

I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in GitOps/ArgoCD.

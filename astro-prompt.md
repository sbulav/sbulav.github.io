Analyze this blog. What are the modern/cool engine alternatives?
Check out this site, which I like how it look/behave https://buildkite.com/


1. Let's build from scratch, looking like buildkite, but:
- I like top menus with [] shortcuts
- I don't like rotating logo
- I like bottom input box, but I want to use it for quick navigation around my blog, with vim-like bindings (like :help, / for search, etc..) I also want it to be shrinkable or hideable
3. Yes, preserve, ideally keeping incoming links from search engines
- Make sure that tags and categories have all the entries

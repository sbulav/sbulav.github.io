Just finished reading "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality". This is by far the best
funfic I've ever read.

If you love Harry Potter's universe and ever wondered, what if:
* Harry would try to analyze magic using science
* Harry would be smart badass
* Harry would had his own dark side

then this book could take you into a wonderful journey.

I highly recommend reading this book, or at least giving it a try(and try to get to at least chapter 10),
especially since this book is free and available both in [English](http://www.hpmor.com/) and [Russian](https://hpmor.ru/).

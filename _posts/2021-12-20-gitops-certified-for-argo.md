I've passed the course [GitOps Fundamentals](https://codefresh.learnworlds.com/course/gitops-with-argo)
and follow up exam: ![GitOps Certified for Argo](/assets/images/gitops-certified-for-argo.png)

The course is free, and all you need to pass the Exam is some time and patience.

The course gives some insights how ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts works. In a simple way.
Even if you never worked with ArgoCD you'll be taught how to install it, 
configure it and deploy applications with it.

What I especially liked about the course, is that every chapter has practice lab(running entirely
in the cloud), where you can play with solutions.

If you don't understand what GitOps is, or want to try ArgoCD or Argo Rollouts,
then this course is worth time investment.

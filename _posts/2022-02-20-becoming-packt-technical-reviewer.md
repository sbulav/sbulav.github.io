I've became a technical reviewer for the book [Kubernetes â€“ An Enterprise Guide - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/kubernetes-an-enterprise-guide-second-edition/9781803230030)

Today I've received my printed copy of the book:

![book01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28604639/150093342-118f72e8-7d59-4d92-ace3-fc903241feda.jpg)

![book02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28604639/150093483-072eee36-8d56-46ff-8689-a4b67a88f9db.jpg)

I thought that I should share my thoughts if it's worth it.

When you agree to became a technical reviewer, you sign a contract with Packt.
For me, the benefits were:
- 500$
- Printed copy of the book
- Yearly subscription to the [Packt Pub](https://www.packtpub.com/)

This may sound like a good deal, but don't forget that you will spend a lot of
hours troubleshooting broken scripts, not starting Docker images, etc...
Multiply those hours to a rate of a high-grade engineer, and the deal don't look
good anymore.

What's really great about becoming a technical reviewer is that you will meet
brilliant people, who are on the edge of technology. You will dig deeper into
each chapter as you troubleshoot solutions, recreating the whole setup over and
over again.

And, of course, having your name on a printed book is something you can be
proud of.

Even though working on the book was time-consuming, I really enjoyed the process
and the result.

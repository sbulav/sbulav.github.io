I've passed some free courses and corresponding certifications, which I find
pretty useful.

## Certified Calico Operator: Level 1

[CCO-L1](https://academy.tigera.io/course/certified-calico-operator-level-1/)
course will arm you with the knowledge you need to understand how Kubernetes
networking works, how to configure and manage a Calico network, and how to
secure your cluster following todayâ€™s best practices, with the confidence you
need to run mission critical workloads in production.

I liked this course, it took me 4 hours and it was worth the investment even
if you don't use Calico.

## Certified Calico Operator: AWS Expert

[CCO-L2-AWS](https://academy.tigera.io/course/certified-calico-operator-aws-expert/)
course will help you understand several options for deploying Kubernetes
in AWS, and also examine how the default AWS networking works. It will also
describe how to configure and manage Calico in AWS, and how to secure your AWS
Kubernetes cluster.

Again, if you work with AWS and are interested in eBPF, then this course can shed
some light on it. It also explains in simple words how you can face IP address
exhaustion with VPC CNI and how you can prevent it using Calico.

## Kyverno Fundamentals Certification

[Kyverno
Fundamentals](https://learn.nirmata.com/courses/kyverno-fundamentals-certification)
will test you the basic concepts of Kyverno, along with installation, policy
definitions, results, and security.

This is an in-depth Quiz on Kyverno, helping you to reveal your weaknesses. If
you work with Kyverno, check yourself, and try to pass it.

I've passed the course [Certified Rancher Operator: Level 1](https://academy.rancher.com/courses/course-v1:RANCHER+K101+2019/about)
and follow up exam: ![Certified Rancher Operator: Level 1](/assets/images/rancher-certified-operator.png)

The course is free, and all you need to pass the Exam is some time and patience.

I figured out couple of new concepts about Rancher and clarify confusion about
Rancher, RKE and rke.

If you work with Rancher on a daily basis or want to investigate what Rancher is,
then this course is worth time investment.

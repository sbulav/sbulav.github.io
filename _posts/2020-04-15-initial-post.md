I've always wanted to start a blog, and finally I had some time to investigate github pages and create this `awesome blog`.
We'll see if I'll have enought time and courage to constantly write posts, but I have serious intention to do so.

I'll start by reponting my linkedin certification's posts and continue with notes on Kubernetes, Azure, certifications
and other tech I'm interested in.

Here's links to jekyll docs I've used to configure this blog:

* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Minimal Mistages theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
* [jekyll-docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home)
* [jekyll-gh](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

Finished reading "The Complete Software Developers Career Guide" by John
Sonmez.

Not the newest one, but it's still pretty actual. Author is pretty biased and
narcissus, but he has many good ideas in his book. For example, I liked the
life-work balance sections, how to deal with coworkers, how to look for a job.
Book is easy to read, it feels like you're talking with your friend and not
reading huge technical book.

Overall it's definitely worth reading.

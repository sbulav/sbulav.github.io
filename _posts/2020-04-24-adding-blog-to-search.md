I've added blog to Google and Yandex search engines.
This was by no mean an easy task. I've went throught following steps:
* Add [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) to blog
* Validate site and add sitemap to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
* Validate site and add sitemap to [Yandex Webmaster](https://webmaster.yandex.ru)

Suddenly I realized that many many brilliant tech blogs with excellents guides or
ideas simply aren't in search. And when you're not in search you don't exist to the
world.

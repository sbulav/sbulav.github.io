To understand what's going on on the market, it's useful to apply
to open positions from time to time.

This provides an opportunity to:
* figure out your weak spots
* understand fair pay for your skills and knowledge
* solve interesting technical challenges

One of such interesting technical challenges which I've received
was to draw a decision tree how Kubernetes autoscaler can be
debugged in cloud provider.

I came up with the draw.io scheme, and I thought it might be useful
for someone:

![Debugging autoscaler]()


You can also check scheme in `.drawio` format from my Google drive:

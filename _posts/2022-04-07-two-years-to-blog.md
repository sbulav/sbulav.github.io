Today marks two years of this blog. I wrote my first post on this blog on 2020.04.15.
For two years, I wrote 73 posts, some of which become popular.

In this post, I'll share some statistics about my blog, and I will use
Google Analytics for that.

## Audience

My audience slowly grew from zero, recently passing 1k unique visitors.
Gaining a large audience was never my goal, so for me, that's a pretty big
number.

Most of my views are from the USA, with India in the second place.

By far, most of my audience came from organic search, i.e. Google and DuckDuckGo:

## Blog posts

Here are some statistics about my blog posts:

Among my posts, the most popular one is [passed RedHat PE180](https://sbulav.github.io/certifications/passed-redhat-pe180-exam/).
When I wrote this post, there was little to no information about this
certification, so I hope it was useful for a lot of people. I know that it's
not that relevant since I've passed the preliminary exam, but it still contains
some useful information.

Number two is [Passing custom data to AzureRM](https://sbulav.github.io/terraform/terraform-azurerm-compute-custom-data/).
Terraform documentation is not clear about this, and it took some time for me
to figure out how you can pass custom data to AzureRM. According to the number of
views, I am not the one with the same problem.

In the third place comes [Passed Certified Kubernetes Security Exam](https://sbulav.github.io/certifications/passed-certified-kubernetes-security-exam/).
Again, at the time of writing this post, there was no information about this exam. 
The exam itself is pretty difficult, so I hope my tips helped people to pass it.

## Final thoughts

By no means, I am not a professional blogger. I am just an engineer, sharing
my thoughts and experiences. Sometimes I receive kind words from the people whom I
helped and that's very encouraging. But most of the time, I don't get any
responses, and that's fine.

Overall, I think that writing a blog is a great way to improve yourself as
an engineer and open possible opportunities for yourself.
